        <h3>THE ARMOURED CORPS</h3>
        <br />
        <img src="assets/image/combat-img1.jpg" />
        <br />
        Armoured Corps, successor to the erstwhile cavalry, retains the elan of the horse borne warrior of old, along with that infuriatingly languid air of confidence, of never being seen as perturbed in public. This is a necessity and not a facade. The mechanised battlefield is exceptionally demanding and requires enormous reserves of physical, mental and moral stamina to get through the 'noise and dust'. The Armoured Corps ethos reflects professional competence and makes demands on individual soldiers far beyond those necessary in other vocations. The Indian Armoured Corp's operational success continues to be founded on moral strength and martial spirit, and it takes tremendous pride in the achievements of the past, seizes the demands and opportunities of the present, and focuses always on the challenges of the future. At the core lies the enduring principles of the Fire Power and Shock Action, the application of which will always have a most devastating effect on the enemy.

        <h3>THE INFANTRY</h3><br />
 <img src="assets/image/combat-img2.jpg" />
 <br />
 The least spectacular of all arms, but without which you can do nothing, nothing at all". True to these words, Infantry has been the foremost fighting arm from the days of yore. History is testimony to the fact that the ultimate victory in any war is decided by the Infantry. It is the infantryman who pushes the enemy out of his bunker and forces him to accept defeat; or, resolutely holds ground against the assaults of the enemy till the "last man last round". Like all armies the world over, Infantry is the prime arm of the Indian Army. It is with the Infantry at the core that the rest of the Army is configured, both during war and peace. If Army is the last bastion of National security, Infantry remains its penultimate strength.
<br />
All wars since 1947 have been witness to the heroic deeds of Infantry troops who have performed their tasks successfully in adverse climatic conditions and terrain to protect the Nation's integrity and sovereignty. The Indian frontiers remain in the hands of infantrymen, from the staggering high altitudes of the Siachen Glacier, the impregnable jungles of the north-east to the scorching heat of the Thar Desert. The low-intensity conflict operations have been a constant, and perhaps the most prolonged operation for the Army. Insurgencies in the North - East, Jammu and Kashmir and, in the past, Punjab have been live examples of Infantry centric operations which are characteristically complex, delicate and sensitive. The Infantrymen have invariably performed well. Besides, the world over in various United Nations peace-keeping operations, our Infantry has earned tremendous good-will and carved a niche for itself and the Nation.

 <h3>THE INFANTRY</h3><br />
 <img src="assets/image/combat-img3.jpg" />
 <br />
 The Gunners are a breed apart. Their professional attitude, work ethics and training regimen prepares them to face any contingency which may evolve in their flexible fire plan. Gunners exude confidence and infuse the same among others. This ability is reflected in their motto SARVATRA, IZZAT - O - IQBAL to provide fire-power for all eventualities, where-ever required, in whichever form required.
<br />
<br />
<h3>ARMY AVIATION</h3><br />
 <img src="assets/image/combat-img4.jpg" />
 <br />
 Ability to observe deep into the enemy area has always been one of the quintessential pre-requisites of warfare and the 20th Century saw a major revolution in warfare when the advent of airpower added a third dimension to the battlefield on land and in sea. Building from those days, Army Aviation Corps, the youngest Corps in the Indian Army has notched up an enviable record of successes, awards and decorations. It is an amalgamation of diverse influence and traditions of the ‘Aviation’ and the ‘Army’. The motto ‘Suveg Va Sudrid’ clearly narrates the daily ongoing epic of Army Aviation’s ceaseless operational involvement across diverse terrains, in contrasting weather and climatic conditions in a variety of difficult situations. Nothing describes the omnipotence of Aviation’s reach and presence better than it’s ubiquitous round the clock application in the present day context. To add to this are the inborn demands of the environment as Aviation requires enormous reserves of physical, mental and moral stamina. The men and machines, of the Army Aviation Corps, have done yeoman service during the two major wars and innumerable missions of mercy in peace-time for which they have earned accolades far out of proportion to their small numbers.

<br />

<h3>ARMY AIR DEFENCE</h3><br />
 <img src="assets/image/combat-img5.jpg" />
 <br />
 The Corps of Army Air Defence, though a nascent arm, has evolved into a highly professional and modern arm of Indian Army. The personnel of Corps of Army Air Defence perform their duty with speed and flexibility; with utmost zeal and enthusiasm. In the contemporary battlefield characterized by versatile aircraft, flying at speed well beyond that of sound, the Air Defence men have to be capable of real time monitoring and rapid decision making, to live up to the Corps motto of AKASHE SHATRUN JAHI (Kill the Enemy in the Sky). The Corps of Army Air Defence is always "First In and Last Out" in the gamut of operations and in addition to attacking the enemy's critical assets, provides credible air defence cover to vital assets of strategic importance and to critical assets of field forces.
 <br />
<br />
 <h3>THE CORPS OF ENGINEERS</h3><br />
 <img src="assets/image/combat-img6.jpg"  className="combatedge-img-7"/>
 <br />
 The Corps of Engineers with their motto of SARVATRA (Ubique in Latin, or 'Everywhere' in common parlance) are a league apart. The officers of the Corps of Engineers are armed with a degree in engineering. The 'Sappers' (as the Engineers are commonly known) are adept at a wide variety of important operational tasks ranging from minefield laying and clearing, bridging, road construction, handling of explosives etc. Mobility and counter-mobility can be termed as some of the important aspects of warfare in which the Engineers play a major role.
<br />
<br />
<h3>THE CORPS OF SIGNALS</h3><br />
 <img src="assets/image/combat-img7.jpg" className="combatedge-img-7" />
 <br />
 The Corps of Signals is responsible to provide, deploy and leverage the strength of communication networks and ensure cyber security, both during peace and war. The vast Information Communication and Technology (ICT) infrastructure created by the Corps of Signals brings about the necessary synergy amongst various arms/ services by providing voice, video and data connectivity to units and formations thus fulfilling the motto TEEVRA CHAUKAS. They also connect soldiers deployed at far flung remote locations to their kith and kin. The Information Warriors, as they are popularly known, are more fortunate than others since they are constantly on the job, thus ensuring high state of training and morale. The importance of their role inculcates a sense of pride, confidence and sophistication that is unmatched. All said and done a Signaller's life is worth living and dying for.
